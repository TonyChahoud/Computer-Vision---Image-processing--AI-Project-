Lisence plate detection
Computer Vision is a unique field of data science that deals with images instead of conventional datasets. Unlike other data science fields, Computer Vision attempts to emulate human vision by identifying, processing, and understanding images in a manner similar to the human brain. One of the most common applications of Computer Vision is license plate detection, which is easily recognizable and distinct.

In this article, we will explore the process of detecting license plates using Computer Vision techniques. Through this, we will gain a deeper understanding of the potential applications and capabilities of Computer Vision technology.
